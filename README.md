# IV-Bag-monitoring-system
**Built as a part of PESU-CIOT summer internship (Jun 2022 - July 2022)**

An IoT based automatic alerting device that consists of  Light Dependent Resistor and an Ultrasonic sensor to detect the laser which is employed to constantly monitor the fluid level. When the fluid level is below the critical level which will be defined by ultrasonic sensor, it will alert the patient through buzzer.Whenever there is a bubble formation inside the IV-Bag it is determined by the light source and an LDR sensor.Nurses and doctors through web app (built using firebase and bootstrap).

1.Arduino Uno

2.Light dependent resistor(LDR)

3.HCSR-04 Ultrasonic sensor

4.Esp8266-01 wifi module
